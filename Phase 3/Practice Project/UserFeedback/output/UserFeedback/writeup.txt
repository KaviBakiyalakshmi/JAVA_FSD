Step by Step Process

First I used SpringInitilzr to create my project. After downloading it I loaded it into
eclipse and edited the Application Properties file to connect with my database. I added
dependencies to the pom.xml file and added a homepage with forms to input feedback and
view the table of all the feedback. I created a feedback page for displaying all the feedback
which uses the toString method from the feedback class and outputs it in a table format. I
created a controller for the update to show that the feedback was successfully updated to the
table. This controller has a link to the feedback page to view the table. I made a class called
FeedbackRepository which extends CrudRepository to make the necessary changes to the table.
Last, I made css changes to have the website be more visually appealing
