Project objective:
--------------------

 Create a servlet-based web application that shows a form to add new 
       products.

 A MySQL database will be created to store product data.

 
The form data will be validated, and a row will be added to the database. 

All database processing will be done using Hibernate.

Background of the problem statement:
----------------------------------------


       As a part of developing an e-commerce web application, you have to create a 
database table for storing product information. A form is needed to add new 
products.
 
    The form submission is validated, and a new record is created in the 
product table.

STEP1: First I have created a new Dynamic web Project. Then inside the project, 
create servlet and create a class and hibernate.cfg.xml file.

STEP3: Inside index.jpg page, html file is linked to it.

STEP4: First of all, we have create a database.

STEP3: Inside the html page, I have create form.

STEP5: then it will send the response to servlet ,and we get the configure 
connection from hibernate.cfg.xml.

STEP6: From the xml file connection is created to the database and the objects
created in the servlet are get stored in the table. 

STEP 7: Finally, we can insert the row to the my sql database to the table using hibernate
