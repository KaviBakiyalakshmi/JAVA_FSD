Longesting Increasing Subsequence order
----------------------------------------


step 1: First we have to Iterative function to find the longest increasing subsequence
         of a given array


Step 2: then stores the LIS[i] stores the longest increasing subsequence of subarray
         `arr[0…i]` that ends with `arr[i]`


step 3: LIS[0] denotes the longest increasing subsequence ending at `arr[0]`


step 4: after start from the second array element


step 5: do for each element in subarray `arr[0…i-1]`

step 6: To find the longest increasing subsequence that ends with `arr[j]`
           where `arr[j]` is less than the current element `arr[i]`

step 7: To include `arr[i]` in `LIS[i]`


step 8: j` will store an index of LIS

step 9: Finally print LIS
